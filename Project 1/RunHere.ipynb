    "Overall the code feels very messy and the battle function is way too long but I think this gave a lot of insight into how to structure these projects in the future <br>\n",

    "To my knowledge, there is nothing you can enter that will \"break\" the code or throw an error, if something is found please let me know<br><br>\n",
    "The hardest part of making this code by far was the Save/Load features, Class instances will not save in a json so all items and pokemon and the player needed to be converted to dictionaries<br>\n",
