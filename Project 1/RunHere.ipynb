    "Overall the code feels very messy and the battle function is way too long but I think this gave a lot of insight into how to structure these projects in the future <br>\n",
    "Most of the work at the end was bug fixes and getting everything to work properly.<br>\n",
    "To my knowledge, there is nothing you can enter that will \"break\" the code or throw an error, if something is found please let me know<br><br>\n",
    "The hardest part of making this code by far was the Save/Load features, Class instances will not save in a json so all items and pokemon and the player needed to be converted to dictionaries<br>\n",
    "This solution I think caused the bulk of the issues in debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Project 3 Update:\n",
    "All comments were revieved, some were not chosen to be implemented, on those ones we replied to the comment to discuss why\n",
    "I have found no errors in the game as of now, but I may or may not have figured out a hack 0__0 (check json)"
