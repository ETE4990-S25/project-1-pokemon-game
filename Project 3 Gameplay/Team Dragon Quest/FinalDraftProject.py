# ETE 4990 Python Project #1

# My rant/notes: I wanted to make it so that the character wanders throughout the game, but at that point, I would be making -->
# a whole story, so the only game for this project is fighting against a slime, which is based on the game dragon quest. I want to
# add more players to the party and I can, but I don't want the person to have to control all of them and press attack 4 times for a single turn,
# plus, 1 party member is enough for this project, as the slime is too weak. And it's somewhat easy to do it, I just made this project
# in its simplest form for you to get the idea

# I also want to add more items to the game, but I don't want to make the game too complicated.
# I also have it so the user gets their items back every time you load the game because if I didn't do that,
# I would have to create a whole story so they can wander around and get items, but that will go over the 400 lines of code limit
